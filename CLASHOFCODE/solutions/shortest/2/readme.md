 	Goal
In chemistry, simple alkanes are made of carbon and hydrogen atoms. According to the IUPAC nomenclature system, they are named by the number of carbons they contain (here are the first 5 alkanes):

- methane CH4 (1 Carbon atom, 4 Hydrogen atoms)
- ethane C2H6 (2 Carbon atoms , 6 Hydrogen atoms)
- propane C3H8 (3 Carbon atoms, 8 Hydrogen atoms)
- butane C4H10 (4 Carbon atoms, 10 Hydrogen atoms)
- pentane C5H12 (5 Carbon atoms, 12 Hydrogen atoms)

Given a diagram of a molecule find its nomenclature (its IUPAC name).
Input
Line 1: An integer N for the number of lines used to draw the diagram of a molecule.
Next N lines: A diagram of a molecule consisting of characters H and C for the element hydrogen and carbon respectively; - and | to represent the bonds.
Output
A single line containing NONE if the given molecule is not an alkane. Otherwise, output the IUPAC name of the given molecule (methane, ethane, ...).
Constraints
0 ≤ N ≤ 15
